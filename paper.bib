It is shown that the derived form of the finite difference Jacobian prevents nonlinear computational instability and thereby permits long-term numerical integrations.},

	title = {{GRILLIX}: a {3D} turbulence code based on the flux-coordinate independent approach},
	journal = {Plasma Physics and Controlled Fusion},
	abstract = {
        The GRILLIX code is presented with which plasma turbulence/transport in various geometries can be simulated in 3D. The distinguishing feature of the code is that it is based on the flux-coordinate independent approach (FCI) (Hariri and Ottaviani 2013 Comput. Phys. Commun. 184 2419; Stegmeir et al 2016 Comput. Phys. Commun. 198 139). Cylindrical or Cartesian grids are used on which perpendicular operators are discretised via standard finite difference methods and parallel operators via a field line tracing and interpolation procedure (field line map). This offers a very high flexibility with respect to geometry, especially a separatrix with X-point(s) or a magnetic axis can be treated easily in contrast to approaches which are based on field aligned coordinates and suffer from coordinate singularities. Aiming finally for simulation of edge and scrape-off layer (SOL) turbulence, an isothermal electrostatic drift-reduced Braginskii model (Zeiler et al 1997 Phys. Plasmas 4 2134) has been implemented in GRILLIX. We present the numerical approach, which is based on a toroidally staggered formulation of the FCI, we show verification of the code with the method of manufactured solutions and show a benchmark based on a TORPEX blob experiment, previously performed by several edge/SOL codes (Riva et al 2016 Plasma Phys. Control. Fusion 58 044005). Examples for slab, circular, limiter and diverted geometry are presented. Finally, the results show that the FCI approach in general and GRILLIX in particular are viable approaches in order to tackle simulation of edge/SOL turbulence in diverted geometry.

	journal = {Plasma Physics and Controlled Fusion},
	abstract = {Nonlinear dynamics in the two-dimensional multi-component plasma turbulence described by the Hasegawa–Wakatani equation is investigated by using a data-driven modal analysis with the singular value decomposition (SVD). The conventional SVD is extended to ‘multi-field SVD’ which can decompose multiple turbulence fields simultaneously by a single set of orthonormal basis functions without imposing a priori scale separations. Then, in addition to the mode amplitude labeled by the singular value, the information on the phase relations in the nonlinear quantities such as a transport flux or a triad energy transfer is extracted in the mode space. Through applications to the two-dimensional plasma turbulence, it is revealed that the multi-field SVD can extract the dominant spatial structures for the turbulent transport and the nonlinear energy transfer, preserving the multi-scale nature of the original turbulent fields. It is also demonstrated that one can reduce the dimensionality or information using the multi-field SVD through comparisons with the conventional Fourier decomposition.}
