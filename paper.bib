  abstract   = {The integral constraints on quadratic quantities of physical importance, such as conservation of mean kinetic energy and mean square vorticity, will not be maintained in finite difference analogues of the equation of motion for two-dimensional incompressible flow, unless the finite difference Jacobian expression for the advection term is restricted to a form which properly represents the interaction between grid points, as derived in this paper. It is shown that the derived form of the finite difference Jacobian prevents nonlinear computational instability and thereby permits long-term numerical integrations.},

  abstract = {{The impact of adiabatic electrons on drift-wave turbulence, modeled by the Hasegawa–Wakatani equations, is studied using information length. Information length is a novel theoretical method for measuring distances between statistical states represented by different probability distribution functions (PDFs) along the path of a system and represents the total number of statistically different states that a system evolves through in time. Specifically, the time-dependent PDFs of turbulent fluctuations for a given adiabatic index A are computed. The changes in fluctuation statistics are then quantified in time by using information length. The numerical results provide time traces exhibiting intermittent plasma dynamics, and such behavior is identified by a rapid change in the information length. The effects of A are discussed.}},

  abstract  = {Drift-wave turbulence produces anomalous transport via cross-correlations between fluctuations. This transport has profound implications for confinement, structure formation, and virtually all aspects of the non-linear turbulent dynamics. In this work, we use a data-driven method based on deep learning in order to study turbulent transport in the 2D Hasegawa–Wakatani system and infer a reduced mean-field model from numerical solution. In addition to the usual turbulent diffusion, we find an effect which couples the particle flux to the local gradient of vorticity, which tends to modulate the density profile. The direct coupling to the shear is relatively weak. In addition, the deep learning method finds a model for spontaneous zonal flow generation by negative viscosity, stabilized by non-linear and hyperviscous terms. We compare these results to analytic calculations using quasilinear theory and wave kinetics, finding qualitative agreement, though the calculations miss certain higher-order effects. A simplified, 1-D model for the evolution of the profile, flow, and intensity based on the deep learning results is solved numerically and compared to previous models for staircasing based on bistability. We see that the physics uncovered by the deep learning method provided simple explanations for the formation of zonal structures in the density, flow, and turbulence fields. We highlight the important role of symmetry in the deep learning method and speculate on the portability of the method to other applications.}
